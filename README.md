## Architecture

### Models & Relationships
- **User** â†’ hasMany Books, Albums
- **Book** â†’ belongsTo User, hasMany ReadingSessions
- **Album** â†’ belongsTo User, hasMany ListeningLogs
- **ReadingSession** â†’ belongsTo Book
- **ListeningLog** â†’ belongsTo Album

### Key Controllers

## Database Schema

The application uses a well-structured database with the following main tables:

- `users` - User authentication and profiles
- `books` - Book metadata and reading status
- `reading_sessions` - Individual reading session tracking
- `albums` - Music album information
- `listening_logs` - Music listening history

## API Endpoints

All routes are protected by authentication middleware:

```
GET    /books              - List all books
POST   /books              - Create new book

PUT    /books/{book}       - Update book
DELETE /books/{book}       - Delete book
POST   /books/{book}/reading-sessions - Start reading session
PUT    /books/{book}/reading-sessions/{session} - End reading session
